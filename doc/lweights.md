[...]We reconstruct the covariance matrix C by multiplying a
weighting function to each of its diagonal terms C_i , and the
weighting is given as C_i <- C_i G^1_i . The weighting function
G_i=L_i×Z_i, in which L_i and Z_i are functions of distance
and spatial coverage dependent, respectively. For distance-
dependent weighting, L_i is assumed to be in the form of
L i  exp−ΔR 2 i =D 2 
L i  1=1  ΔR 2 i =D 2
in which a spatial smoothing parameter D is introduced. Both
functions allow reduced weight of the data as distance in-
creases.
