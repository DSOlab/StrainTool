# Strain Tool

Software to compute Strain and/or Strain Rate parameters based on GNSS-derived
tectonic velocities.
First step will be the development of a stand-alone program; after testing and
validation, a corresponding web service will be setup, utilizing the developed
libraries.

## Software

 * The software will be free and open-source.
 * Development will be performed using github (https://github.com/).
 * All interested parties will be able to download (clone) the software from
   github https://github.com/DSOlab/StrainTool and make (local) changes.
 * The language of choice is Python; despite the fact that Python2.x and
   Python3.x are not fully compatible, effort will be made to make the
   software independent of the language version.
 * Any third-party software used, will be free and open-source.

## Implementation

The software shall be able to read in GNSS-derived information (including
station name, station coordinates, station tectonic velocities, standard
deviations and correlation coefficients) from ascii text files (see [1]).

[1] implies that the optimal algorithm for deriving strain strain patterns
(given the specific needs of EPOS), is described at [2]. Hence this will be
the algorithm implemented within the software. Additionaly, an alternative
algorithm will also be available, namely the one described at [3].

The output will be the list of estimated parameters and shall be written to
ascii text files. Special care will be taken, to also output parameters
related to the plotting of strains/strain-fields (oriented towards using
the Generic Mapping Tools software (http://www.soest.hawaii.edu/gmt/)).
