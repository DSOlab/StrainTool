README on MIDAS Velocity fields

When using these velocities in publications please cite:

The MIDAS velocity files are automatically updated weekly from the GPS time series generated by the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory.
Columns on the MIDAS velocity files are as follows:
column 1 - 4 character station ID
column 2 - MIDAS version label 
column 3 - time series first epoch, in decimal year format. 
column 4 - time series last epoch, in decimal year format (See http://geodesy.unr.edu/NGLStationPages/decyr.txt for translation to YYMMMDD format).
column 5 - time series duration (years).
column 6 - number of epochs of data, used or not
column 7 - number of epochs of good data, i.e. used in at least one velocity sample 
column 8 - number of velocity sample pairs used to estimate midas velocity
column 9-11 - east, north, up mode velocities (m/yr)
column 12-14 - east, north, up mode velocity uncertainties (m/yr)
column 15-17 - east, north, up offset at at first epoch (m)
column 18-20 - east, north, up fraction of outliers
colums 21-23 - east, north, up standard deviation velocity pairs 
column 24 - number of steps assumed, determined from our steps database
column 25-27 - latitude (degrees), longitude (degrees) and height (m) of station.
